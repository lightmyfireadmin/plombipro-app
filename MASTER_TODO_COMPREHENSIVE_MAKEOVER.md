## 📝 NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### Development Approach
1. **Fix Critical Bugs First:** Phases 6, 7, 8 must be completed before any new features
2. **User Testing After Each Phase:** Get feedback before moving to next phase
3. **Mobile-First Design:** All UI changes should prioritize mobile experience
4. **Incremental Deployment:** Deploy fixes as they're completed, don't wait for entire phase

### Team Resources Needed
- **1 Senior Flutter Developer:** For core architecture and complex features
- **1 UI/UX Designer:** For glassmorphism design and illustrations
- **1 QA Tester:** For thorough testing after each phase
- **1 Product Manager:** To prioritize and coordinate phases

### Estimated Timeline Breakdown
- **Month 1-2:** Phases 6, 7, 8, 2 (Critical bug fixes)
- **Month 3-4:** Phases 3, 5 (Client pages, Dashboard)
- **Month 5-6:** Phases 1, 11 (Profile, Features)
- **Month 7-8:** Phases 4, 12, 9, 10 (Wizards, Design, Tutorials, Night mode)
