## 🚩 COMPETITOR WEAKNESSES (GAPS TO EXPLOIT)

### 1. **Lack of True Differentiation**
Most competitors are **feature parity** players - similar features, competing mainly on price or interface polish.

- Limited mobile optimization

### 4. **Pricing Transparency**
Many competitors **hide pricing** behind contact forms = friction

### 5. **Speed Not Emphasized**
Despite time being plumbers' biggest asset, few competitors **quantify time savings**

### 6. **Supplier Data Entry Pain**
HUGE unaddressed pain point = **manually entering supplier invoice data**
